		<p>Task 1: <br>
		   The De Casteljau algorithm linearly interpolates the points between the points given as input to the algorithm. It continually repeats this process on the newly created<br>
		   points. Once down to the final point, the algorithm has defined a point on the Bezier curve. I implemented the algorithm by multiplying the coordinates of the first of the pair <br>
		   of coordinates by 1 - t and adding it to the coordinates of the second point multiplied by t.

		<p>Task 2: <br>
		   Essentially, Bezier points along one axis can be grouped together along the other axis and linearly interpolated using the same algorithm to get points that <br>
		   lie on the Bezier curves of both axes, providing a curve for the entire surface.

		<p>Task 3: <br>
		   The area weighted vertex normals was calculated by taking the cross product of two of the edges in each of the attached faces of the vertex and summing them up. <br>
		   The cross product provides the normal vector, and since we're using the edges of the triangle, their lengths are being accounted for in the cross product effectively <br>
		   weighting the normals by the areas of the triangles.
