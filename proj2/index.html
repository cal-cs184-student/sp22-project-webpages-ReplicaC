		<p>Task 1: <br>
		   The De Casteljau algorithm linearly interpolates the points between the points given as input to the algorithm. It continually repeats this process on the newly created<br>
		   points. Once down to the final point, the algorithm has defined a point on the Bezier curve. I implemented the algorithm by multiplying the coordinates of the first of the pair <br>
		   of coordinates by 1 - t and adding it to the coordinates of the second point multiplied by t.
