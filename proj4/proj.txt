pt 2.
with low spring constant, cloth appears thinner and more loose, while with a high spring constant, the cloth
becomes very stiff. Note that with very high spring constants, the material could start "pulling in on itself,"
and even higher spring constants can lead to the cloth kind of clipping around everywhere.

The effect that changing density exhibits seems opposite to that of adjusting the spring constant. High density
makes a flowy looking cloth and a low density leads to a stiffer material.

with low damping, the cloth stays constantly in motion, coming to a stand still extremely slowly. With high
damping, the cloth moves very slowly, appearing as if it were submerged in water.
